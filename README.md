# Maximum-Sum-Contiguous-Subvector-Problem
Comp 3270 Algorithms Programming Assignment
This program involves an empirical analysis of algorithms that involves implementing, running and then analyzing the run-time data collected
against theoretical predictions. This program implements, and theoretically and empirically computes
the complexities of algorithms with different orders of complexity to solve the problem of Maximum Sum
Contiguous Subvector defined as follows:

Maximum Sum Contiguous Subvector (MSCS) Problem: Computes the sum of the subsequence of numbers (a
subsequence is a consecutive set of one or more numbers) in an array of numbers (for this HW, we will use integers)
that sum to the largest value possible; but if this value is negative, MSCS is defined to be zero. E.g., in an array of
all positive (or all negative) numbers, the Maximum Contiguous Subvector consists of all numbers in the array (or
zero). There may be multiple Maximum Subsequences in an array, all of which sum to the same largest sum. E.g., in
an array of all zeroes, MSCS =0 and any 0 in the array is a Maximum Subsequence. Remember that the input array
may contain zeroes, negative and/or positive integers. For example, if the input is [1,2,-4,3,-5,2,0] then MSCS =3
and there are two Maximum Subsequences that sum to the same MSCS: A[1]+A[2]=1+2=3 or A[4]=3.
